        My Story...
    </h2>


    <p>
        I've worked in basic and clinical research for around 20 years and the last 16 years specifically doing bone histomorphometry. Way back in my first research position I became interested in coding when I messing with macros in Excel. A few years later I found myself learning visual basic and soon after that, the C# language. I wrote code off and on over the years but every time I stopped for a while, I found myself getting drawn back to it -- wanting to build something or try something. After spending time learning Javascript I found myself making excuses to program in my real job. That's when I finally realized I need to learn how to build and code the proper way <em>and</em> I need to make it my day job. Now with the love and support of my wife and daughter, here I am... and I'm <strong>freaking excited!!</strong>

        A little about me and music
    </h2>
    <p class="right">
        Writing and playing music has been a passion of mine for more than 30 years. I have been in bands from high school and throughout my professional life. I feel incredibly lucky to get to play my music for people and sometimes I even make a little money! I've never broken even and probably never will, but that's ok by me. I just love doing it and will continue for as long as I possibly can. Please check out a few demos and my band page below if your interested.

    <p class="right">
        Now that music and coding are both a big part of my life, one goal of mine is to integrate both into one project. I don't have the tools to achieve that yet but that is just one more reason I've enrolled in coding bootcamp. I honestly don't know what I'm going to do but It will be something very cool to me. If anyone else digs it, thats just gravy.
